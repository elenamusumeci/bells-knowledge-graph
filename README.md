# BELLS Knowledge Graph
BELLS Knowledge Graph stores information about Italian bells, bell towers and bell ringers.
[...]

BELLS Knowledge Graph can be queried on the **[ArCo SPARQL endpoint](https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql)**.
Moreover, it can be downloaded in different formats (see [here](http://dati.beniculturali.it/resource/datasetCampaneLiguria)).


BELLS Knowledge Graph is described in two dedicated MELODY data stories: **[Overview of the bells in Liguria](https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/bells/overview_of_the_bells_in_liguria)** and **[Bells on the map](https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/bells/bells_on_the_map)**.
